## Sirius Tooltip

>The Sirius Tooltip is wrapped around the SiriusLabel and SiriusLed components so that when you click with the scroll button, the name of the PV being monitored in the component will appear.

An example of how it is used in the code:
```
  <SiriusTooltip text="This will appear on the tooltip">
     children component
  </SiriusTooltip>
```
